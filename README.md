# Machine Learning Practice Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed during my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**. Each project showcases practical applications of core ML concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation using real-world datasets.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 1. 🎓 Student Performance Prediction
- Explored the impact of study habits, motivation, sleep, and parental involvement on exam scores.
- Performed EDA, data preprocessing, and built a Polynomial Regression model.
- Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
- Visualized actual vs predicted values.

### 2. 🛍️ Customer Segmentation
- Applied K-Means clustering on mall customers based on income, age, and spending score.
- Used Label Encoding, Standard Scaling, and the Elbow Method.
- Visualized clusters and insights for business segmentation.

### 3. 🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification
- Built multi-class classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict forest cover types.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Analyzed feature importances and model accuracy using classification metrics.

### 4. 💸 Loan Approval Prediction
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) to predict loan approval.
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and addressed class imbalance.
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
